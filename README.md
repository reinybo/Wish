# Wishlist

Wishlist makes it easy to keep track of everything you are thinking about purchasing from **ANY** website. Unfortunately most wishlist features that one finds on most shopping websites only allow the user to add items from that *particular website*. Not only can users collect items from multiple websites, but they can organize the items into particular wishlists (ex. birthday, apartment-decor etc.). The user can confidently exit the browser and return at a different time to find their items still on the page due to Wishlist's helpful register/log-in feature.

## Getting Started

## Future Enhancements 

I hope to continue working on Adoptable--particularly, I hope to include more drop-down menus of dog traits in the side bar. I also wish to work out a few kinks with regards to the need to refresh the page for every new search. I also would like the user to be able to select only some filters instead of all. I also would like to work on the CSS to make visual aspects of the website more appealing.
