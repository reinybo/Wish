# Wishlist

Wishlist makes it easy to keep track of everything you are thinking about purchasing from **ANY** website. Unfortunately most wishlist features that one finds on most shopping websites only allow the user to add items from that *particular website*. Not only can users collect items from multiple websites, but they can organize the items into particular wishlists (ex. birthday, apartment-decor etc.). The user can confidently exit the browser and return at a different time to find their items still on the page due to Wishlist's helpful register/log-in feature.

## Future Enhancements 

In the future, there are a few features I would like to add. Firstly, I would like to be able to filter/sort the items by price, tag, store, etc.. Additionally, I would like the user to input the link to the item which will trigger the other inputs to auto-populate with likely values retreived from the given link. I also want the user to be notified of pricedrops of items on their wishlists, and lastly, I would like to improve the mobile-browsing experience.
